    "description": "\nThe daily SAP determines the futures price and is used to indicate supply constraints and demand pressures. These data are accessed weekly, in a Monday to Sunday format. The data can be subject to extreme within-day trading prices, which can lead to skewing of actual traded prices. It must also be noted that while these data reflect spot prices on the day, traders can opt for futures contracts where the buyer and the seller agree the market-determined price for gas for a future date. Other markets also exist for wholesale gas trading in Great Britain. Despite this, the scope of SAP is sufficient to provide a representation of supply constraints and demand pressures in the gas industry.",
