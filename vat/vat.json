    "summary": "Diffusion indices created using HMRC VAT returns, and associated number of firms contributing to those indices",
    "description": "Diffusion indices show changes in business turnover (total value of all sales and other outputs excluding VAT), and expenditure (total value of purchases and all other inputs excluding VAT), for both month-on-month and month-on-a-year-ago.\nVAT reporters received in the first seven days after the reporting period are included. Given that there are normally five working days in the first seven days of the month, the data content is relatively consistent month to month. This cut-off date was chosen to increase timeliness, while also being the earliest date when the key economic sectors provided a sufficiently accurate indicator of economic performance.\nMore quality and methodology information is available in Faster indicators of UK economic activity: Value Added Tax returns.",

Conversely, an index of negative 0.05 means that 5% more firms reported a decrease in turnover compared with the equivalent month of prior year."
