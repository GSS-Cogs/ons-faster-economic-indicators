        - Identifier: UK port visits by ships
        - Comment: Counts of daily ship visits to selected UK ports, by ship type
        - Description: Ships equipped with Automatic Identification System (AIS) equipment on-board transmit positional information every 2 seconds when moving and up to 3 minutes when anchored or moored. Originally introduced for navigational safety, AIS data can also be used as a source of information for monitoring trends in shipping activity.
		We collect and aggregate these messages to identify the number of ships that travel within a port bounding box and remain there for a series of transmissions, before travelling outside of the boundary again. The AIS messages also allow us to identify a subset of all ships as cargo and tanker ships.
		This dataset provides the number of daily visits for 16 of the UK's most significant freight ports by tonnage, and a sum of those visits as a UK total. The UK total is seasonally adjusted using the seasonal adjustment method TRAMO-SEATS modified to deal with higher frequency time series.
